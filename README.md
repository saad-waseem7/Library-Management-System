# Library Management System

This is a simple command-line (Menu-Base UI) Library Management System implemented in C++ (OOP). It allows users to manage books, members, and book transactions within a library.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Allows librarians to add new books to the library catalog.
- **Remove a Book**: Enables librarians to remove books from the library catalog.
- **Search for a Book**: Provides functionality to search for books by title, author, ISBN, or publisher.
- **Display Available Books**: Shows a list of available books in the library.
- **Checkout a Book**: Allows library members to checkout books.
- **Manage Members**: Provides options to add, remove, and search for library members.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Covered

This project demonstrates the following OOP concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: The code is organized into classes such as `Book`, `Library`, and `Member`, representing real-world entities.
- **Encapsulation**: Data members of classes are encapsulated and accessed through public member functions, maintaining data integrity.
- **Abstraction**: Each class provides a clear interface (public member functions) for interacting with its data, hiding the internal implementation details.

## Usage

1. Compile the code:
2. Run the executable:
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.
